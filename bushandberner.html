                Bush's "As We May Think" is a very insightful piece that he wrote in 1945. He introduces an idea for a desk computer, which is very similar to the later invention of the laptop.
                Bush calls this idea a "memex." In his description of the memex, it is a a full office desk with built in technology that operates as a computer.
                Just like a laptop, the memex stores books, records, and communications, and operates with efficient speed. It's very impressive that Bush considered this idea before there was any plan of a laptop.
                It shows the power of his creative mind and the importance of imaginative thoughts.
