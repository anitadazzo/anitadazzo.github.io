                Bush's "As We May Think" is a very insightful piece that he wrote in 1945. He introduces an idea for a desk computer, which is very similar to the later invention of the laptop.
                Bush calls this idea a "memex." In his description of the memex, it is a a full office desk with built in technology that operates as a computer.
                Just like a laptop, the memex stores books, records, and communications, and operates with efficient speed. It's very impressive that Bush considered this idea before there was any plan of a laptop.
                It shows the power of his creative mind and the importance of imaginative thoughts.

                    Tim Berners-Lee created the world wide web in 1990. It is crazy to think that it all started with one website and one browser. In Long Live the Web, Berners-Lee discusses how the internet has transformed since then and the dangers that have arised. For example, the government has the ability to monitor peopleâ€™s searches, which endangers human rights. Also, social networking sites have the ability to block information posted by their users from the rest of the internet. I enjoyed reading this article because the issues that Berners-Lee brought effect everyone. We take advantage of web usage but if we dont bring attention to these issues, our privacy will continue to get violated.
