                    In the first episode of Ways of Seeing, John Berger 
                    makes the statement that artwork is 'still and silent.'
                    It is each persons specific perception of the artwork 
                    that brings it to life and gives it meaning. For example, 
                    looking at a painting with undisturbed silence would be 
                    a different than observing it will heavy metal playing in 
                    the background. Same goes for if there is slow classical 
                    music playing in the background. Basically, Berger points
                    out the atmosphere a piece of art is being observed can
                    completely alter the meaning the person finds in it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other factors that may effect how a person is perceiving 
                    artwork is how old the person is, the size of the art, the 
                    colors portrayed, the tools used, and style of the artwork 
                    on display. There are many components that factor into how 
                    each person perceives art and this ties into how each person 
                    perceives themselves. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    I agree with Berger that each person is unique to how they 
                    percieve artwork and everyone can find different meanings in 
                    the same work of art. I don't think that tis concept ends 
                    with artwork. Everybody is unique to themselves, so it is a 
                    given that each person percieves the world around them 
                    differently.

                    This observation that Berger explains seems to be very obvious
                    when you spend time and give it thought. But, I honestly 
                    hadn't given it much thought prior to watching the videos. Most
                    people probably don't give much thought to this because we think 
                    about the things we see as objects and we lose the meaning. What 
                    I mean is if a group of people all looked at a picture of a horse,
                    everyone would understand that it was a horse, but everyone would 
                    also resonate with the picture differently given there past experiences
                    with horses.

                    Although I only touched on one specific point Berger made in the first 
                    episode, I was able to really dive into the points he made. The ideas he has
                    about how humans percieve artwork are very interesting and can be
                    quite thought provoking.
