                    Chapter seven begins with the theory that every human activity that doesn't stem from reproduction or survival is art. 
                    Basically, everytime we're not eating or having sex, we are using our own thoughts to decide what we want to do. Different people 
                    express their thoughts through different forms of art. Some might be more "artistic" than others, but all actions require thought and 
                    creativity, which makes them art. The random activities that we create in our heads "provide exercise for mind and
                    bodies not recieving outside stimulous... provide an outlet for emotional imbalances, aiding mental survival", and they lead to useful discoveries(167).
                    I personally really like this concept because I agree that everything we do for our own desire and happiness is a form of creativty, and therefore art.
                    McCloud says that eating isn't a form of art because it is for survival but I think that WHAT and HOW we eat is very much a form of art.
                    The way a person prepares food says a lot about them and there are definitly people who find passion and creativity in preparing meals for themselves and others.
                    McCloud goes on to explain that occupations are very much related to creative desire.

                    "'Pure' art is essentially tied to the question of purpose-- of deciding what you want out of the art. This is as true in comics as it is in painting, writing,
                    theater, film, sulpture, or any other form"(169). Then McCloud presents the 6-step path of any work. He explains the path from the mind of a blossoming comic writer.
                    Different people go further in each of the 6 steps, depending on what their goal is. Some people are satisfied just pursuing cartoons as a hobby, but some go further: getting 
                    perfessional approval, finding their style, and recieving recognition for their hard work. The same goes for every hobby or occupation. But almost everyone starts their journey from end to beginning;
                    from the surface to the core purpose.
