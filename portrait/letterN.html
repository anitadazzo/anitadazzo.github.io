                    Narcissus is a genus of spring blooming flower bulbs that are of the amaryllis family. All daffodils, paperwhites and jonquils are narcissus bulbs. Narcissus typically produce a single, bare stem with a flower of six petals surrounding a cup or trumpet shaped corona. Often all yellow or all white, there are many that are bicolor, with orange and a peachy pink as the accenting color. Some narcissus produce multiple flowering stems per bulb, and still others produce flower clusters on several stems. Some produce fully double flower forms, and others have split coronas and intriguing forms. Some narcissus are very fragrant with sweet, floral notes, or sometimes a heavy musk.

                    Daffodils should be planted in the cooling soils of fall.  In some climates, that begins in early September, and in very warm areas it is in late November. While you can hang onto your daffodil bulbs for a few weeks, or even a couple of months prior to planting them, I do not recommend it. Do not refrigerate your bulbs, but store them in a cool, dark, dry place with good air circulation until it is time to plant them.
