                    "It is easy to plant tulips in the garden. Pick a sunny site that has good drainage. Tulips won’t grow well in shade and will rot in wet soil. Soil preparation is important when taking care of tulips. Dig the area and loosen the soil about a foot (30 cm.) deep. You should add some compost or dried manure to the soil. Also, add some 5-10-5 or 5-10-10 granular fertilizer to help the bulbs grow. Mix the existing soil,  amendments, and fertilizer, just like a cake batter until well blended. After you have properly prepared the site for the tulips, you can easily dig the individual planting holes. You need to dig each hole three times as deep as the tulip bulb is tall. There should be twice as much soil over the tip of the bulb as height of the bulb, so if your tulip bulb measures 2 ½ inches (5 cm.) tall, dig your hole 8 inches (20 cm.) deep, so you’ll have 5 inches (13 cm.) of soil above the bulb. You should plant the bulb in groups of ten if you’re putting them in your perennial border, and space them a couple of inches (5 cm.) apart. Set the bulb so the pointy end is facing up. Don’t worry if you get some upside down. They should flower anyhow, but it will take them longer to come through the ground in spring and they may not be as tall as they should.
