                    "Plant rhizomes of the iris in a sunny location with well draining, rich soil for optimum flowering. Leave room for growth between the rhizomes and do not bury the entire rhizome. Make sure roots are covered, but allow the iris rhizome to remain partially above ground to avoid root rot. Once blooms fade, leave the foliage to yellow before removing from the flower bed. Plant so later blooming specimens cover the remaining foliage. As with many spring blooms, the foliage is sending nutrients to the rhizome for next yearâ€™s flowers. This is one of the difficult parts of iris care, as many gardeners wish to immediately remove foliage once flowering is done. Other iris plant care includes watering during dry spells, fertilization before flowers appear and deadheading of the spent blooms. However, most clumps of iris provide flowers with no maintenance. Iris is drought tolerant and may be part of a xeric garden; keep in mind, even drought tolerant plants benefit from an occasional watering."
