                    "Maracanã, officially called Estádio Mário Filho, was built to serve as the flagship venue for the 1950 World Cup. It was meant to become the biggest football stadium in the world.

                    Construction began in August 1948 and was completed almost two years later. Maracanã officially opened on 16 June 1950 with a friendly between a selection of players from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.
                    Maracanã hardly changed until the 1990s, when a deathly accident and resulting safety measures greatly reduced capacity. Shortly later it got converted into an all-seater. Maracanã is owned by the state of Rio de Janeiro, but has grown to become the regular home of Flamengo and Fluminense. Other Rio clubs such as Botafogo and Vasco da Gama also occasionally use the stadium for high-profile matches."
