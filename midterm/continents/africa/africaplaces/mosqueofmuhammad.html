                    "Thanks to its outstanding splendor, the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, which is also known as the Alabaster Mosque, is today one of the most frequently visited mosques in all of Egypt. In fact, it might even be the most visited mosque in the country. There are several reasons why the mosque has proved to be so popular, over and above the fact that itâ€™s such an exquisite site. For example, the mosque also has impressively high minarets, the view one gets from the top of the minarets is second to none. Visitors can see practically the entire city, including the Giza Plateau."
