                    "The Japanese remake of the Eiffel Tower serves a predominately practical purpose. The orange and white tower, which rises 1,092 feet into the air, serves as a radio and television broadcasting structure supporting 62 miles of frequencies. The tower also caters to tourists, offering two observation decks, one at 490 feet  (the main observatory) and one at 819 feet (the special observatory). The observation decks offer 360-degree views of Tokyo's sprawling cityscape and come equipped with guides pointing out notable buildings in the skyline. And if you visit on a really clear day, you'll be able to spot Mount Fuji in the distance. The Tokyo Tower also has its own cafe, where patrons can sip tea while admiring the views, as well as Club 333, a music venue that hosts performances daily. And if you're on the hunt for souvenirs, travelers say this is a surprisingly great place to peruse thanks to all the on-site shops."
