                    "Located on a manmade island 280m off Jumeirah Beach, Burj Al Arab (meaning Tower of the Arabs) is a luxurious hotel that is the fourth tallest hotel in the world. Measuring 321m, the hotel was opening in 1999 and was designed to resemble a ship's sail. Reportedly the world's only 7 star hotel, Burj Al Arab offers the ultimate in luxury featuring a 180m tall atrium, a fleet of white Rolls Royce cars, dancing fountains and touches of gold leave everywhere. Designed to make a statement and become synonymous with Dubai, the building resembles the sail of an Arabian water vessel know as a dhow. A vast 'mast' creates the intersecting point for two 'wings' which open out into a V formation. The space between the wings is where you'll find the massive enclosed atrium."
